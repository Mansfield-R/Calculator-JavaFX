  <p align="center">
    The goal of this project is to make a shareable and usable basic calculator which implements the immediate 
    execution mode of operation. This calculator will allow you to ADD, Multiply, Divide, and Subtract.
    I also wanted to explore JavaFX, create something using what I've learned from
    studying java, and get lots of feedback from people who are way better than me.
